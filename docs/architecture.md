# Product architecture — confirmed design (M1–M3)

Per-package confirmed decisions and gotchas for `src/before_we_ai/`. Feature list
and status: `docs/requirements.md`. Working rules: `meta/conventions.md`.

## Dev environment

- Python 3.13, venv at `/workspace/.venv` (system pip is externally-managed)
- Repo root: `/workspace` — https://github.com/happychriss/before-we-ai
  (`pyproject.toml` lives in `src/`)
- Install: `source /workspace/.venv/bin/activate && pip install -e '.[dev]'` in
  `/workspace/src`; run `python -m pytest -q` there (183 tests green after M3,
  incl. claim_viewer)
- Authoritative German spec: `docs/spec/`

## Epistemic core (`model/`, `store/` — M1, tags m1-core-v1/v2)

- `model/` is pure and IO-free; `store/` is a YAML repo with append-only evidence,
  integrity check, optional git checkpoint.
- **Status is derived, never set**: `resolve_status(claim, evidence)` recomputes
  from non-stale evidence, order-independent. Conflict (probe fail + anything
  supporting) → unresolved; fail alone → contradicted; confirmation →
  business-confirmed; pass → tested; weak evidence never promotes.
- **Five evidence types** (derived enumeration; spec says "die fünf Evidenztypen"
  without listing): probe_result | document_anchor | confirmation | testimonial |
  declaration. Pydantic validators enforce actor consistency — AI structurally
  cannot author promoting evidence.
- **Mirror-loop guard (F29)**: confirmation on a testimonial claim requires explicit
  `Scope` or `attach_evidence` raises `PromotionError`; `resolve_status` also
  ignores inadmissible confirmations.
- **Claims are semantic rules, not rows**: identity = Predicate(name+params) +
  Scope + Validity + source_ids, hashed by `semantics.claim_key()` (wording
  excluded); `store.add_claim()` dedups on key. Probe evidence is aggregate-only
  (population / exception_count / exception_samples capped at 20 / result_ref
  parquet). `escalate_exception()` mints a child claim (provenance via
  `derived_from`, NOT status-bearing; child starts inferred). Impact is derived
  (`gap_load()`), never stored.
- Reference usage demo: `tests/acceptance/test_walkthrough.py` (9-step
  "Umsatz-Claim" scenario, F15/F29).

## Ingestion & profiling (`sources/`, `profile/`, `scan.py` — M2, tag m2-ingestion-v1)

- **One canonicalization everywhere**: `canonical_text()` + SQL twin
  `canonical_sql_expr()` (unit-tested to agree) bridge BIGINT 1101 / DOUBLE 1101.0 /
  Excel numbers / text '1101'. Genuine text is sacred — leading zeros never
  stripped. Every rewrite class has a rule tag.
- **Normalization decisions = DECLARATION evidence** by `Actor.SYSTEM` (can only
  author anchor/declaration). Dedup on (payload, source_fingerprints) so re-scans
  append nothing. Scan creates ZERO claims — false promotion impossible by
  construction.
- Excel pre-reader: merged-header resolution (parent_child names), all values →
  canonical text → all-VARCHAR Parquet in `cache/normalized/` (DuckDB COPY, no
  pyarrow). CSV read `all_varchar=true`.
- **Catalog**: `cache/analysis.duckdb`, views `<source>__<table>` (xlsx views named
  after sheet title). GOTCHA: views over ATTACHed DBs die on a fresh connection —
  re-open via `sources.open_catalog(root)` (or re-run `build_catalog`, idempotent).
  `cache/` is disposable: delete + re-scan ⇒ identical output, stable profile IDs.
- **Candidate matrix**: stage-1 prefilter (distinct≥2, value-class compat,
  cross-table; hard cap 50k pairs with TRUNCATED warning), stage-2 set-based
  overlap on distinct canonical values; containment threshold 0.5. Deterministic
  JSON+MD in `profiles/` (no timestamps). The matrix measures, never judges —
  chance overlaps deliberately included.

## Probes & engine (`probes/`, `engine/` — M3, tag m3-probes-v1)

- `probes/REGISTRY`: name → TemplateSpec(file, prepare, verdict, tolerances,
  question); 13 Jinja2 templates in `templates/*.sql.j2`, split by
  `-- ::exceptions::` marker into population + exceptions query. Verdicts
  deterministic.
- **Verdict granularity comes from the claim**: anti_join param
  `expectation: "empty" | "report"` — report-claims (K6 legitimate orphans) can
  structurally never FAIL, only INCONCLUSIVE + drafted Fachfrage (QuestionCard,
  deduped by exact text).
- **Cardinality probe = chance-overlap counter-evidence (T6)**: PASS needs
  containment ≥ 0.95 AND parent uniqueness ≥ 0.99.
- Invariants attach to claims like everything else (RoleBindingClaims; F27:
  journal=buchungen_report FAIL → contradicted, rendered SQL kept as reason).
  Amounts CAST, not TRY_CAST — un-castable values crash loudly.
- **Tolerances**: defaults per TemplateSpec; overrides ONLY via `before-ai.yaml`
  `tolerances:` (scalar normalized to `{absolute: v}`).
- **Evidence contract per run**: probe_id + rendered exceptions-SQL + summary in
  payload, source_fingerprints per view, samples ≤20, full exception set →
  `cache/probe_runs/<evidence_id>.parquet`. Probe persisted before its evidence;
  integrity checks probe refs.
- `run_ready`: probes topo-sorted by claim; `ready_for_probe` gates (deps ≥
  tested); claim-less probes first; returns RunReport(executed, skipped(reason)).
- Normalization is part of the claim: T1 passes canonical, fails with
  `canonical: false` (raw CAST). decode template checks functional dependency,
  not string equality.

## Claim viewer (`claim_viewer/` — external, hands-off)

`python -m claim_viewer <project_root> -o <out.html>` → one self-contained HTML.
